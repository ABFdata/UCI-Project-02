**Gini Coefficient**: Measures income inequality of each country. A Gini coefficient of zero expresses perfect equality, where all values are the same or everyone has the **same income**.  A Gini coefficient of 1 (or 100%) expresses maximal inequality where only one person has all the income or consuption and all the others have none.
